## My name is Ben Bankston

I am studying economics and data science at Washington and Lee University. 

As part of the data science minor, I have learned to source, collect, and analyze data effectively and ethically. See below for information on how I have hit on each goal of the Data Science minor:
1. I have collected and used data in Econ 202, Econ 303, and Bus 314. In each course, we first evaluated our needs for data, then set out to find sources that satisfied those needs. In each case, sources were cited in the final product.
2.	Largely, I have found data by searching the web for existing databases. Bus 314 was my first experience data scraping, and it helped me better understand how information is built into and navigated on the web.
3.	In Econometrics, we cleaned a self-made dataset that we analyzed for a final project. Linear algebra taught me the basics of the data matrix transformation that is key to analysis. 
4.	Both stats and metrics required me to learn from predictive and descriptive statistics. In Bus 314, we used a set of descriptive statistics to draw conclusions about the data. The programming skills I used to do this were developed from CS 111 and CS 112.
5.	Regression analysis in metrics & mapping in Bus 314 helped me visualize data in a way that I had not before.
6.	Bus 314, Stats, and metrics required summarizing results in a final paper and 2 of them included a poster presentation to share ideas with people from every background.
